Port4U leverages Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to calculate the optimal risk-return trade-off for a given set of assets. Key financial concepts and metrics include:

1. **Expected Return**: The weighted average of individual stock returns based on historical data.
2. **Portfolio Variance and Volatility**: Measures the risk of a portfolio by considering the covariance between asset returns.
3. **Sharpe Ratio**: Indicates risk-adjusted returns.
4. **Efficient Frontier**: Visual representation of optimal portfolios that offer the highest return for a given level of risk.
5. **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Estimates potential losses in a portfolio over a specified time frame.
